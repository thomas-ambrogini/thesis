\chapter*{Abstract}

This master thesis explores the development and implementation of a Pub/Sub
(Publish/Subscribe) platform customized for embedded devices.
The initial phase of the project involves a comprehensive analysis of the
chosen embedded board, going into its specifications and capabilities.
The central focus lies in facilitating communication between heterogeneous
processors, aiming to establish seamless connectivity and data exchange.
The thesis also investigates the integration of real-time cores alongside Linux
cores, balancing the need for responsive performance with the versatility of
a Linux-based system. 
Through experimental evaluations, the thesis assesses the platform's
performance in different scenarios.
