\chapter{Future Directions}

For the end of the thesis, it is important to outline potential directions for
future investigations in the realm of pub/sub middleware for embedded systems.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item   integration with edge computing:
            explore the seamless integration of the pub/sub middleware with
            emerging edge computing paradigms. Investigate how the middlewre
            can enhance communication efficiency and resource utilization in
            edge computing scenarios.
    \item   Security and reliability enhancements:
            Delve into enhancing the middleware's scurity features and
            reliability mechanisms. Investigate lightweight cryptographic
            protocols and fault-tolerant strategies tailored to the resource
            constraints of embedded systems.
    \item   Exploration of AI investigation:
            explore the integration of artificial intelligence techniques with
            the pub/sub middleware to enable intelligent data filtering,
            prediction, and adaptation in response to dynamic changes in the
            embedded environment.
    \item   Introduce new protocols which can be used inside the system. Maybe
            industrial level protocols.
\end{enumerate}
